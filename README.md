# Project1
Hello!
The steps to use this GUI are simple and as follows:
1. Run the function (either by pressing the "Run" button at the top or through the command window)
2. Input your desired volume and choose the corresponding units (L, mL, m^3, or ft^3)
3. Input your desired mass and choose the corresponding units (kg, g ,mg, or lb)
4. Press solve

And viola! You now know the density based on your volume and mass. 

Note: Make sure that the code is saved with the correct name
